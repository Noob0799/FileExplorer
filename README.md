# File Explorer
A File Explorer with functionalities like:
- Add File
- Add Folder
- Edit File/Folder Name
- Delete File/Folder

Note:
- The existing file/folder tree structure shown is due to the manually created JSON data structure.
- User can add file/folder to an existing folder. The newly added file/folder will show up as a child of the parent folder.
- Files/folders can only be added to an existing folder and not a file.
- User can edit existing file/folder's name.
- User can delete existing file/folder. The deleted file/folder will no longer show up in the folder structure.
- Every add, edit or delete will modify the JSON and re-render the folder structure.
- To add/edit a folder/file, type the name and hit Enter. If user clicks outside, the add/edit action will be cancelled.
